# Branch database-connections

The goal for this branch was to allow the site to perform CRUD operations.

### Progress

So far, we have Create operations rudimentarily implemented. To finish it, we want

- review console.log statements to reduce clutter on the server
- [x]Client side validation (within the form) and error messages
- [x]Server-side validation and error messages
- [x]redirect page on successful creation
- [x] remove step/instructions button instead of only add on the form
