# Branch database-connections

The goal for this branch was to allow the site to perform CRUD operations.

### Progress

So far, we have Create operations rudimentarily implemented. To finish it, we want

- review console.log statements to reduce clutter on the server
- Client side validation (within the form) and error messages
- Server-side validation and error messages
- redirect page on successful creation
- remove step/instructions button instead of only add on the form
